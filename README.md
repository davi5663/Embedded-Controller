# Embedded-Controller
<b>Short description:</b><br/>
In this project I have worked with Embedded Controller. I made a few small functions which I used C++ as my programing language. To my project, I have used 2 diodes
a button an LCD Screen and a TouchSensor. <br/>
<b>The Libraries I used for my project:</b> <br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os.git">mbed-os 6.2.0</a> <br/>
<a href="https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/code/BSP_DISCO_F746NG/">BSP_DISCO_F746NG</a> <br/>
<a href="https://os.mbed.com/users/cmatz3/code/Grove_LCD_RGB_Backlight/">GROVE_LCD_RGB_Backlight</a>

<b>Functionality:</b><br/>
When the Controller starts up you will see a Welcome page with a black background with my name and a welcome message. When you press the button you will be 
redirected, to a new screen. 
When you don't press the button, a message will be shown. When you press the button a new message will show up and the diodes will begin to blink. 
When pressing the TouchSensor it will reset the counter, and a little message will also show up.

<b>Changes/Problems/New Functions:</b><br/>
In the future I want to make a rectangle to be used as a button! I could not do it because of I do not have that much knowledge with mbed. I did have some troubles
and problems, but I managed to fix them. But in the end I can say that I am really happy and proud of what I created considering, this is the first time 
for me using mbed and also C++.
