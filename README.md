# Embedded-Controller
<b>Short description:</b><br/>
In this project I have worked with Embedded Controller. I made a few small functions which I used c++ as my programing language. To my project, I have used 2 diodes
a button and an LCD Screen.

<b>Functionality</b>
When the Controller starts up you will see a Welcome page with a black background. When you press the button you will be redirected, to a new screen. 
When you don't press the button, a message will be shown. When you press the button you will get a new message and the counter will be reseted on the LCD screen.
The diodes will begin to blink.
