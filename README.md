# Embedded-Controller
<b>Short description:</b><br/>
In this project I have worked with Embedded Controller. I made a few small functions which I used C++ as my programing language. To my project, I have used 2 diodes
a button and an LCD Screen.

<b>Functionality:</b>
When the Controller starts up you will see a Welcome page with a black background. When you press the button you will be redirected, to a new screen. 
When you don't press the button, a message will be shown. When you press the button you will get a new message and the counter will be reseted on the LCD screen.
The diodes will begin to blink.

<b>Changes/Problems/New Functions:</b>
In the future I want to make my rectangle to be used as a button! I could not do it because of I do not have that much knowledge with mbed. I did have some troubles
and problems. But in the end I can say that I am really happy and proud of what I created considering, this is the first time for me using mbed and also C++.
